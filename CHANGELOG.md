# COP2080SoundProject

## Some heading
Not yet sure what to put here

## Important dependencies / files
- pydub needs ffmpeg or avlib. For ffmpeg on windows, download the executables and put them in the projects local dir. Could also add executables to path but that's cringe.
- Audio files used in code are included in this commit, should remove later.

## Other notes
- problemTest.wav is the 2channel wav from canvas, just renamed
